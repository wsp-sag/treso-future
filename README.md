This repo is a landing pad for submitting feedback on the TRESO system and ideas for future directions. To post a comment or question simply click on the Issues tab and submit a new issue. You can optionally assign the issue to a specific person if you know that it applies to them. You are welcome to comment on issues others have posted. Files can be added to the `uploads` folder that contain additional information, sketches, whiteboard photos, etc. All of the posted issues will be reviewed by the development team on monthly basis.
